```

1. Explain the similarities and differences between boosting and bagging with
regression trees.


2. Download this data: https://bit.ly/PredAnalytics HW6 containing 7 variables and 1000 observations. Using the variable labeled “Y” as the response, fit a model with x1-x6 as predictors using the R function “gbm”.
Use k-fold cross validation with a reasonoble choice of k to find the optimal value of the shrinkage parameter, λ. Plot λ versus mean squared
error over a reasonable range of λ’s

```{r}

data <- read.csv("/Users/carleebettler/Downloads/HW6.csv")

library(gbm)
set.seed(1)


```
